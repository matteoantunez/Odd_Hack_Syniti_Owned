To the extent any translated version of this Agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Agreement covers:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>

<li><p>Payment &amp; Support Terms (Including Automatic Renewal, Cancellation, Refunds, Support and Updates)</p></li>

<li><p>McAfee Contact Information</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>LICENSE TERMS</p>
<p> </p>
<p> License Grant For Personal Use. We are pleased to grant you, an individual consumer, a personal, non-transferable, nonexclusive term-limited license to install and use any Software and Services for which you have purchased a subscription for personal use on the number of devices and for the number of users specified in your License Entitlement or Service Entitlement, as applicable, subject to the System Requirements .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"License Entitlement" means the number and type of devices and users that are permitted to use the Software, as specified in the documents that accompanied your purchase or download, which (depending upon the channel from which you purchased the license) may include: the checkout payment page, a product description page on our website, the email confirmation that we send for the purchase, the package if purchased at a retail store, or another document made available to you when you purchased the product. If no licensed device count or user count was specified, the License Entitlement is for a single device and user.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Service Entitlement" means the scope and duration of the Services you purchased, as specified in documents made available to you when you purchased the product. If no scope or duration is specified in the documents, the Service Entitlement is for a single device and user for one year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"System Requirements" means the supported devices and operating systems that the particular McAfee product will function properly with, as listed on our website. It is your responsibility to meet System Requirements, such as obtaining updates or upgrades in order to continue using the Software.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>License Grant for Small Business Use.  This license permits use of the Software only by personnel employed by the licensed small business entity. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to registration of the Software, we hereby grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Software on the number of devices for which you have purchased subscription licenses as set forth in the documents that accompanied your purchase, provided that such use is only for the subscription term purchased by you, solely by personnel employed by you, and solely for internal business operations. (For the purpose of this Agreement, use of the Software means to access, install, download, copy or otherwise benefit from using the Software). You acknowledge that the Software and all related information are proprietary to us and our suppliers. You will be entitled to Updates which are made generally available by us for so long as you maintain your subscription. This license is revocable by us as provided in this Agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your use of the Software is limited to devices and operating systems we support and may be affected by the performance and compatibility of your hardware, software and Internet access. Meeting system requirements is your responsibility and you are responsible for the cost of your equipment, which may include obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time in order to continue using the Software. System requirements are set forth on the product description page. (For purposes of this Agreement, product description page means either the webpage describing the product and/or the applicable product data sheet).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You must register each license to the Software that you purchase. Registration is required in order to obtain technical support, in order to claim any included Virus Removal Service session per year of annual subscription per purchased license, and so that any licenses that you purchase in the future will have the same renewal date as your initially purchased licenses. Unused sessions do not roll-over to the next subscription year. It is your obligation to ensure that someone within your organization has access to your registration account and the email address identified in the account profile in order to obtain support from us and to receive the pro-rata rate on additional license purchases described below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you purchase additional licenses of the Software which you registered to your account in the future and you use the email address identified in your account profile for the new purchases, the initial term of the additional licenses will be automatically reduced so that the renewal date is the same as the renewal date of the Software licenses you initially purchased.  In that event, you will be charged a prorated subscription price based on a calendar day basis for the reduced initial term. If you do not register your initial licenses to your account, or you do not use the email associated with the account during checkout, you will receive no pro-rata pricing and the subscription term of such additional licenses will be the term that you purchased.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the Agreement terminates for any reason or expires, neither you nor any personnel employed by you will be authorized to use or access the Software, including any online storage or backup services, and we may cancel and/or close your account at our sole discretion. After the termination or expiration date, we will follow our standard policies to delete any of your online stored or backed-up information, text, files, links, images or other materials provided to us ("Content"). It is your responsibility to store or backup your Content elsewhere before this Agreement expires or is terminated. Use of Software, at any time, is governed by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Restrictions. The Software and Services are licensed to you, not sold, and they are protected by U.S. and international laws and treaties. You do not have any right to reproduce or distribute the Software and Services without our permission, and if you do so you may be subject to fines or any other penalties allowed by the civil and criminal laws of the relevant jurisdiction.

If you have installed the Software and Services on a device and you transfer ownership of that device to someone else, you must ensure that any Software and Services are deleted from that device and that the device information is removed from your account with us. We have the right to terminate or suspend this Agreement, your account, and your access to the Software and Services if we determine that you have violated this Agreement. The Software and Services may contain enforcement technology that limits the size of content storage, bandwidth consumption, or the number of devices on which the Software and Services may be installed or that allows us to suspend your access to the Software and Services if you have violated this Agreement or if your License has expired or been terminated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ownership. We, along with our suppliers and partners, retain ownership of our respective Software and Services and all rights related to the Software and Services, including all intellectual property rights. The only rights we grant you are those rights expressly stated in this Agreement. Also, if you provide us any comments, information, opinions, or suggestions on the Software and Services, you acknowledge and agree that we may use them without restriction, for any purpose and without compensation to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Free Software and Courtesy Services. The Software and Services may include: (A) free versions of the Software, including (i) any features included in a paid subscription for which we no longer charge or which we offer to you at no charge, and (ii) any feature that we give you on a trial, courtesy or evaluation basis or that is labeled as "Pre-Release," "Limited Release," "Beta" or otherwise described as experimental, untested, or not fully functional ("Free Software"); and (B) services that we provide without charge to you as a courtesy, which may be labeled similar to Free Software and may be experimental, untested or not fully functional ("Courtesy Services").</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paid Subscriptions. Your right to use the software or services is effective for the length of time of the subscription term set forth in the documents that accompanied your purchase ("Subscription Term") and, where applicable, each subsequent renewal term unless terminated. If the documents that accompanied your purchase do not specify the length of time for which you can use the products or services, your Subscription Term is one year from the date that the Software or Services were purchased. Your renewal of the Subscription Term constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to the then-current version of the McAfee License Agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Free Software and Courtesy Services. Your right to use the McAfee Products or services is effective for as long as the Free Software is installed or we otherwise make the Free Software or Courtesy Services available to you and will remain subject to any limitations set forth in the documents that accompanied your download, as applicable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Changes to this Agreement. McAfee may need to update or change its terms and conditions over time. If you have a paid subscription, any new terms and conditions will apply when your subscription renews. If you do not agree to the new terms and conditions, then you must reject the changes by turning off auto renewal and uninstalling the Software and ceasing all use of any Software or Services at the end of the Subscription Term.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For Free Software and Courtesy Services, you accept change(s) to this Agreement by continuing to use the Free Software or Courtesy Services. If you reject the updated Agreement, your license to the Free Software or Courtesy Services is terminated and you must cease all access to and use of the Courtesy Services or Free Software and uninstall the Free Software.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For all non-European Union customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes. Subject only to the Small Claims Court Option described below in this section, any claim, dispute or controversy of any kind, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory or remedy ("Claim") by either you or us against the other arising from, relating to or in any way concerning the Agreement, the Software, or Services shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not limited to: (i) Claims relating to the enforceability or interpretation of this Agreement, including any of these arbitration provisions; (ii) Claims by you, and also Claims made on your behalf or connected with you, such as an employee, representative, agent, predecessor, successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy; (iii) Claims that relate directly to us, and/or to our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, assignees, employees, and agents; and (iv) Claims that could have been asserted as part of a class action, private attorney general or other collective, consolidated, or representative action, it being expressly understood and agreed to that the arbitration of such claims must proceed solely on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis and the arbitrator shall have the authority to award relief only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT NO CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS MAY BE PURSUED IN ARBITRATION, NOR MAY SUCH ACTIONS BE PURSUED IN COURT. BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND WE AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION OF ANY KIND.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notice of Dispute. The party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating arbitration. When sent to us, notice should be sent to McAfee, 5000 Headquarters Drive, Plano, TX 75024, Attention: Legal Department. The notice must include your name, address, and contact information, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You and we will use reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or we may commence arbitration. Notwithstanding these notice obligations, any demand for arbitration must be made by you or us within the statute of limitations that is applicable to the Claim(s) upon which arbitration is sought or required.  These notice obligations do not modify the statute of limitations that is applicable to any Claim(s).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Administration of Arbitration. If any dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy will be, at the demand of either party, conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not state law. Subject only to the Small Claims Court Option for individual consumers described below, YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. Instead, all disputes will be resolved on an individual basis before a single, neutral arbitrator and the proceeding will be confidential. The arbitrator will be either a lawyer admitted to practice law in his or her jurisdiction and with at least ten years’ experience or a retired or former judge selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA, as applicable, as modified by this Agreement (the "Arbitration Rules"). For more information, see adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. Except with respect to any claims or counterclaims seeking less than $25,000, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned, written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English, and the United States FAA will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the binding arbitration clause in this Agreement. The award will be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law. You and we further agree that a judgment may be entered upon the award by any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration award will determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only, and only in respect to the claims in arbitration, and will not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other dispute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Costs. The party initiating the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee. If you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will reimburse your filing fee. We will pay the fees and costs for the first day of any hearing. All other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the arbitration rules. However, we will advance or reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or if you ask us and we determine there is a good reason for doing so. Each party will bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Small Claims Court Option.  If you are an individual consumer, you may choose to sue us in small claims court in your county of residence or in Santa Clara County, California if you meet the court’s requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Right to Resort to Provisional Remedies Preserved by McAfee. Nothing herein will be deemed to limit or constrain our right to resort to self-help remedies or to comply with legal process, or to obtain provisional remedies such as injunctive relief, attachment, or garnishment by a court having appropriate jurisdiction; provided, however, that we may elect to arbitrate any dispute related to such provisional remedies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Conflicting Terms. In the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules and this arbitration agreement, this arbitration agreement will govern. If any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the other provisions of the arbitration agreement; provided, however, that (a) if the prohibition on class-wide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration agreement will be null and void; and (b) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration agreement will be null and void as to such claims only. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this arbitration agreement and any other applicable arbitration provision, this arbitration agreement will control.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND WE UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THE AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.   IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. This paragraph in no way invalidates the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For European Union Customers – Online Dispute Resolution Service ("ODR") &amp; Alternative Dispute Resolution ("ADR"). We are required by law to provide a link from our website to the EU ODR Platform: https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/consumers/resolve-your-consumer-complaint.

<p> </p>
<p>GENERAL LEGAL TERMS</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Law Covering This Agreement. Except as provided in the Local Law Section below, this Agreement, the use of the Software and Services, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration. If for any reason, the laws of the state of New York are found not to apply, then, except as provided in the Local Law Section below, this Agreement, the use of the Software, Services, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to the Software or Services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Attacks on Data. You acknowledge that some security breaches involve attacks on data. For example, there are viruses and other malware that: (i) delete or destroy your data (sometimes individual files, but sometimes even an entire disk by corrupting a master boot record or other key element); (ii) modify your files (such as parasitic malware that attaches itself to a file and modifies the file to enable its own execution and/or propagation); and (iii) encrypt files on your drive (such as ransomware that uses asymmetric encryption). The best way for you to protect yourself from these types of attacks is frequent back-ups of your data to another device or location. That way, you have another copy of the data that the attacking software has deleted, modified, or destroyed. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove the attacking malware or virus, it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to back-up all data and files on your device so that they can be restored in the event of an attack on your data. Without such a back-up, it may not be possible to restore the deleted, destroyed, or modified data. We will have no liability for loss of or recovery of data, or files or loss of use of systems or networks arising from attacks on data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Limited Warranty. For 30 days after the purchase date ("Warranty Period"), for paid versions of the Software only, we warrant that the Software licensed under this Agreement (including updates provided during the Warranty Period but not for updates provided outside of the Warranty Period) will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation provided by us in connection with that Software at the time of purchase, and that any tangible medium (such as a CD-ROM, but excluding devices manufactured by other companies) on which the Software is contained and provided to you will be free from defects in materials and workmanship. We do not warrant or guarantee that any particular mobile device or computer will be compatible with or function with the Software or Service, nor do we warrant or accept any liability for the operation of your personal equipment that is used to access the Software or Service. Your sole remedy, and our and our suppliers’ entire liability, in case of any breach of this limited warranty is that we will, at our option, refund the price you paid for the license, replace the defective medium that contains the Software, re-perform the Service, or provide an alternative remedy as required by local consumer law in your jurisdiction. These remedies may not be available in some countries to the extent that we are subject to restrictions under applicable export-control laws and regulations. If the tangible medium is defective, you must return it at your expense to the place where you bought it and provide a copy of your receipt. Any replacement medium will be warranted for the remainder of the original Warranty Period.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>This Notice provides information about data we collect, use, and share, and our commitment to using the personal data we collect in a respectful fashion. A copy of this notice can be found at https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/about/legal/privacy.html.</p>
<p>We at McAfee, LLC, including our affiliates (“McAfee”, “we”, “us”, “our”), care deeply about privacy, security, and online safety, all of which are a significant part of our essential mission: to protect users of our products and services (“you” and “your”) from the risks of theft, disruption, and unauthorized access to their online information and activities. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) is designed to inform you about how we collect, use, and share your personal data through our website (our “Site”), products, services, and web-based and mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”) or when you interact with us.</p>
<p>McAfee sells products and services directly to consumers (you can find more information about those products at https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/store/m0/catalog.html), as well as to corporations and business customers (you can find more information about those products at https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products.html).

<p>When you access or use our Services, you acknowledge that you have read this Notice and understand its contents. Your use of our Services and the Site and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice, any applicable Terms of Service (including any applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes) and any applicable End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>As McAfee grows, our business changes, and we may update this Notice at any time as we deem appropriate to reflect those changes. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will notify you by email, in-product notification, or as otherwise required by applicable law. It is important that you check back and make sure that you have reviewed the most current version of this Notice.</p>
<p>This Notice applies to all users of our Services across the world. Some users, including residents of the European Economic Area, may have additional rights depending on where they are located, which are described in this Notice.</p>
<p>What Kinds of Information Do We Collect?</p>
<p>In order to provide our Services, we collect information. Some information you provide directly to us, some we collect automatically through our Services, and some is collected from third parties. In this Notice, “Personal Data” refers to data that could be used, alone or in combination with other data, to identify you as an individual.</p>
<p><strong>We collect information you provide to us.</strong> For example, we collect information when you purchase a product or service, create an account, fill out a form, participate in a contest or promotion, request customer service, or otherwise communicate with us. </p>
<p>The types of Personal Data you may provide includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contact information (such as name, email address, mailing address, and phone number);</p></li>
<li><p>Payment information (including payment card numbers and associated identifiers, billing address, and bank account information); and</p></li>
<li><p>Account log-in credentials (which for some Services may include social network credentials).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We may also collect other information from or about you, such as information about what products you purchased, your interests, demographic information, photographs and videos, and biometric data such as fingerprints or voice prints. You may also provide us with additional data. For example, when you use our identity theft protection services, you will have the option to provide your social media log-in information so that we can monitor your social media accounts.</p>
<p><strong>We automatically collect information about your interactions with the Services as well as devices on which the Services are installed. In some cases, we automatically collect information about other devices connected to the same network as the device on which the Services are installed. </strong></p>
<p>For example, we may collect and use the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Information about the products you looked at or searched for and the Services you used, including time spent and other statistical information.</p></li>
<li><p>Details about your computers, devices, applications, and networks, including internet protocol (IP) address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, Bluetooth device IDs, mobile device ID, mobile advertising identifiers, MAC address, IMEI, Advertiser IDs, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and language, language preferences, battery level, on/off status, geo-location information, hardware type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Services, the date and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information about the links you click and pages you view within the Services, and other actions taken through use of the Services such as preferences.

<li><p>When you use our products to protect your mobile device, we collect geolocation data of the device on which the product is installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Details about your internet, app, or network usage (including URLs or domain names of websites you visit, information about the applications installed on your device, or traffic data); and performance information, crash logs, and other aggregate or statistical information.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to provide you our Services, including to detect and evaluate malware and spam, we may scan, collect, and store data from your files, including emails, attachments, email addresses, metadata, and URLs and traffic data.</p>
<p>We collect this information through our Services and through technologies such as cookies, web beacons or web bugs, and clear GIFs.

<p>We may receive information about you from other sources and combine that information with the information we collect directly.

For our identity protection Consumer Products, we also may collect credit or identity information which we use to help prevent and detect fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information</strong></p>
<p>Certain Services may request permission to access your location. Where you grant this permission, we will collect information about your location using GPS, wireless, or Bluetooth technology.
