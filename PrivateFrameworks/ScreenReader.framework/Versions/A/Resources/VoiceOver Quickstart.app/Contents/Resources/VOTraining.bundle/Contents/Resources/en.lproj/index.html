<p> Lemurs are small primates known as &quot;prosimians,&quot; which means  &quot;before monkeys.&quot; Lemurs are native only to the island of <a href="madagascar.html">Madagascar</a>, off the eastern coast of Africa, and the nearby Comoro Islands.  They range from very small up to about 15 or 20 pounds. The average life span of lemurs is 18 years, the shortest of any primate.</p>

<H2>Facts </H2>

<H3><a name="look" id="look"></a>What do lemurs look like?</H3>

<p>The lemur is a kind of primate, and is related to apes and humans. Most lemurs  have long, pointed noses, which accounts for their excellent sense of smell. The color of their coats varies from reddish brown to gray. Lemurs range in size from the  pygmy mouse lemur, which is the smallest and weighs  one ounce, to the Indri lemur, which is one of the largest and can weigh up to 20 pounds. Lemurs have an excellent sense of smell and very good vision, even at nighttime.</p>

<H3><a name="eat" id="eat"></a>What do lemurs eat?</H3>

<p>Most lemurs eat fruit, leaves, and other plants in the rainforest. Some prefer nectar and others eat only bamboo. The aye-aye lemur likes to dig delicious insects from tree bark using  its claw-like middle finger. Gray  lemurs like to eat  bamboo shoots from the treetops. Ring-tail lemurs enjoy flowers, as well as herbs and smaller animals.  Lemurs who live in zoos can receive gourmet  treats like  vegetarian cookies.</p>

<H3><a name="communicate" id="communicate"></a>How do lemurs communicate?</H3>

<p>Lemurs communicate using their sense of smell. They  have scent glands on their bottoms and  feet that leave odors on every surface they touch. When other lemurs smell those odors, they know another lemur was there. Lemurs also wave their large, full tails in the air to communicate. Their tails  help them balance when they jump from tree to tree.</p>
<h3><a name="types" id="types"></a>How many types of lemurs are there?</h3>
<p>Most scientists believe there are  roughly 88 species of lemurs currently living,  organized into five families of lemurs. Here are some fun facts about several  lemurs: </p>

<H2>History</H2>
<H3><a name="africa" id="africa"></a>Did the early lemurs  live in Africa? </H3>
<p>Scientists thought that lemurs first began on the African continent before the area now known as Madagascar  separated from the continent to form an island. However, recent studies show that Madagascar was separated from Africa before lemurs evolved. Consequently, scientists now believe that lemurs may have migrated to the island on floating vegetation and then lived and evolved in isolation from other primates.</p>

<H3><a name="early" id="early"></a>What happened to the early lemurs?</H3>

<p>Living in isolation on Madagascar,  lemurs  evolved into an amazing array of  species. Fossil remains indicate that some of the species were quite large, compared to the species that exist today. One extinct species is  estimated to have weighed between 350 to 440 pounds, as much as an adult male gorilla.</p>
