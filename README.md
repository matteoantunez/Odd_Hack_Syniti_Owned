# Odd_Hack_Syniti_Owned
This is bits and peace’s of code I’ve found from a hack launched by Syniti and DMR, a Syniti Company a while back. If I could get help understanding and going through this code, that would be great!

Update (05-17-2022): Hack is based in Pearl, a known hacking language with one of the main contributors being one of the 'foounders' of google. Pearl linksto O"rilly, who works with the DOD through the kansas city portal of Pearl site.
